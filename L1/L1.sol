/* What is Solidity?
Object-oriented, high-level language influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript.
Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications â€” 
all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.

pragma solidity is the way of declaring the solidity compiler.
Here, in 0.5.0, 0= version number, 5= major build, 0= minor build.

What is caret (^)?
For example:- pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
First, the version number 0.4.24 refers to major build 4 and minor build 24. 
The caret symbol (^) before the version number tells Solidity that it can use the latest build in a major version range.

    Private/Public functions:
    In Solidity, functions are public by default. This means anyone (or any other contract) can call your contract's function and execute its code.

        Age 16 and name Vitalik is added to people[[16, Vitalik]] array, where Person is just a complex data type (struct)/single element of the array.
